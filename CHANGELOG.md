## [Unreleased] v25.7.3

We use a dedicated Python environment to keep HyDE clean and dependency-free. Just run your scripts with `hyde-shell`â€” this handles the environment for you.

Examples:  
 `hyde-shell mediaplayer.py`  
 `hyde-shell waybar`

- Mediaplayer: RIght click menu for mediaplayer
- Mediaplayer: Scroll up/down to seek
- Waybar: Added a POC implementation of drawers in group modules
- Waybar: Made mpris comparable to custom/mediaplayer. Should be noted mpris is not very customizable.

### Fixed
